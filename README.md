# Customer_Churn_Prediction_Model_Project
Customer churn prediction model project using Python and machine learning to identify customers likely to leave a business.
# 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.
Customer churn refers to customers who are likely to stop using a company’s product or service.
The goal of this project is to help businesses identify high-risk customers so they can take preventive actions to improve retention.
# 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer retention is crucial for businesses such as telecom, SaaS, and subscription-based services.
By predicting churn in advance, companies can:
* Reduce revenue loss
* Improve customer satisfaction
* Target retention strategies effectively

This project builds a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn or not.
# 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
* CudtomerID
* Age
* Gender
* Tenure(Total months in which take services)
* Usage Frequency
* Support Calls
* Payment Delay
* Subscription Type
* Contract length
* Total Spend
* Last interaction

Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)

(Dataset used only for educational and learning purposes)

*Matplotlib / Seaborn*

*Scikit-learn*
# 🧪 Machine Learning Models
The following models were implemented and evaluated:
* *Logistic Regression*
* *Random Forest Classifier*
# 📈 Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using:
* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision & Recall
* Best Model Accuracy: XX%
# 🛠️ Project Workflow
1) Data loading and exploration

2) Data cleaning and preprocessing

3) Feature encoding and scaling

4) Model training

5) Model evaluation and comparison

6) Final prediction
# ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run the jupyter notebook

# ✅ Results
The final model successfully predicts customer churn with reasonable accuracy and provides useful insights that can help businesses take data-driven decisions.
# 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems such as customer churn prediction.
The approach can be extended further using advanced models and feature engineering techniques.
